                                        First change is automated project period. Friends we have been receiving requests from you all that when projects get automatically created from schedule than period should automatically appear instead of NONE  and in  this version we have released this feature. To make it work you need to do some changes in services settings. Here on services on which you have applied schedular you need to provide period selection setting. Period selection - basically asks you when project get created as per schedule it belongs to current month, previous month, next month etc. and when you provide this setting period will automatically appear in all the projects getting created with scheduler.
                                       
                                    </li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Second change you will notice is on project page. On project page you will see a small count on each stage of project. Which indicates how many projects requires your urgent attention today and on which you need to follow up to client or your team or govt. offices.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Third change you will notice on automation page. Friends in the process of making it more easy to use when have shown automation in expanded view which will make you easily understand when automation gets triggered and what action is applied. Further to help you manage it we have given you filters like trigger even, apply to and action. so if you want to see only those automation where email action is applied you can filter action email and it will display all the automation where action is email.

                                    <li>
                                        Fifth change is related to schedular naming. Friends when you create a new schedular or edit the old schedular, you will see name automatically appear. We suggest you to keep default name suggested by system because it will standardise it and your other team members will be stopped in creating duplicated scheduler.

                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Lastly friends I am very delighted to share that now we are totally on cloud which means you will experience greater speed. Further we have changed our billing from prepaid period based commitment to postpaid usage based monthly
                                        billing. which means you will not be charged for days when you don't use system. However if you have concerns about your over usage charge you can definitely set the budget limit for monthly usage.
